To create a repository (repo) on our local machine:

1. Select the folder where we will work or create a new folder, and open the terminal by typing cmd in the address bar of the folder path and pressing Enter. This opens the terminal in the folder's directory.
2. In the terminal opened at this directory, type git init (in lowercase). When you see the message Initialized empty Git repository, it means we have created an empty repository in this workspace.
3. After running git init, the name of our workspace is referred to as the Working Space.
4.Use the command git add . to move the code from the Working Space to the Staging Area, which is the waiting area for changes.
5. To create a version from the code in the Staging Area, use the command git commit -m "version name" (usually, the date is written as the version name). It does not matter whether there is a space after -m.
6. To check the status of the code in the Working Space and Staging Area, use the command git status.
7. To view the versions created in the Commit Store (the place where versions are stored), use the command git log --oneline.
8. To send the created version to GitHub, use git push <GitHub repository URL>. If it is a repository we will use frequently, we can first run git remote add origin <repo URL> once and then use git push -u master to send the code to GitHub.
9. To pull the code sent to GitHub into another working environment, use the command git pull <GitHub repo URL>.
10. To see the address linked to our local repository, use the command git remote -v.
11. If there is a change made on the GitHub side, since the address is already defined, it is sufficient to simply use the git pull command. Similarly, since the address is already defined, we can send our code using only the git push command.
