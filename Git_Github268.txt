To create a repository (repo) on our local machine:

1. Select the folder where we will work or create a new folder, and open the terminal by typing cmd in the address bar of the folder path and pressing Enter. This opens the terminal in the folder's directory.
2. In the terminal opened at this directory, type git init (in lowercase). When you see the message Initialized empty Git repository, it means we have created an empty repository in this workspace.
